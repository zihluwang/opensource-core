This is a very useful `Java` class library. In this update, we have merged the original `commons` library, 
`common-utils` library and `time-lib` library. From now on, you no longer need to import so many class libraries.

Of course, this class library does not need to be referenced separately, you can completely import our other class 
libraries, such as the class library that is convenient for you to use **JSON Web Token** 
[`simple-jwt`](https://github.com/vorbote/simple-jwt) , or it is convenient for you to develop **Web Application**
[`web-dev-suite`](https://github.com/vorbote/web-dev-suite). If you are using the `SpringBoot` framework, you can also 
use the `SpringBoot` optimized [`webdev-spring-boot-starter`](https://github.com/vorbote/webdev-spring-boot-starter).

> The library is now in **_BETA_** test, if you want to help us to test, you could clone this library and use 
> **maven** or **gradle** to build it to your local repository. If you found any bugs or have any question while using 
> it, please do not hesitate to contact us by submitting an **issue** with the situation you met. If you are able to
> fix or improve that problem on your own, we are also welcome your **Pull Request**.
